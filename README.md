# RealURL extension for TYPO3 CMS

This is version 2.x of the famous RealURL extension for TYPO3 CMS. This version is rewritten from scratch and will work only with TYPO3 6.2 or newer.

Repository, bug reporting, pull requests, etc is handled via [github project](https://github.com/dmitryd/typo3-realurl/)

Notes:
* TYPO3 6.2 is supported partially: Backend modules work only with TYPO3 &ge; 7.6
* TYPO3 7.6 and 8.7 are supported fully
* Anything newer than TYPO3 8.7.9999 is not supported and will never be supported. Don't even try.
* If you find errors, please, report them to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dmitryd/typo3-realurl/issues). This place is **only** for bugs. Use TYPO3 Slack (#realurl channel) for questions!
* You are strongly advised to have "Is root page?" set in page properties on all your root pages. Otherwise it is your own fault :)
* If you have questions like "Why did you...", please, read the Developer's page on the Wiki first.
* If you want to contribute, you are welcome! Please, read "Contribution" page in the documentation.
* If you think you found a bug, in 99% of cases it means you did not read docs. Wiki pages are available. RTFM first! :)

Since TYPO3 6.2, 7.6 and 8.7 are EOL now, this extension is going to retire. What does it mean?

1. There will be no new features anymore unless they are sponsored.
1. There will be bug fixes from time to time. Also you can [sponsor](mailto:dmitry.dulepov@gmail.com) a bug fix if you really need it. Otherwise you can
add it to the issue tracker and hope to be fixed :)

I am sorry but after developing and supporting this most popular TYPO3 extension mostly for free since 2006,
I have to stop at some point.
